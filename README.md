# Senior-Project
PLATFORM:
Our project is built on google Colab for the convienence of being able to share code reliably so that we can have all of our code together.

ACCESS:
Use the link below to have access to our projects code.
Colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18AZB-64HYybP11CiO1XRUNhmz_kLM9gG#scrollTo=cEhYqNKE1iYr
Github:
https://github.com/noahpittsville/Senior-Project
	Files that may be needed within the github repository
	- AI-Portion -> labelled_tweets.csv
	- API-Portion -> config.ini (For the Twitter's official API portion)

DISCLAIMER:
By having this link to our Collab code or access to our SP github repository allows any the user to have Access to private information that should NOT be within any user's hand who is not fully trusted. The biggest reason for this is because of the Tokens and Keys readily available within the files of this project. This Later will need to be grabbed in a secure fashion so no one individual, outside the owners of the Twitter bot account, will have access to.

FUTURE PLANS FOR ACCESS:
At the moment, the website is not fully accessable for any individual. It is currently located within CSUB Odin's server which requires steps of authetication. 
Our next step for this project is to make all portions available to any user.
